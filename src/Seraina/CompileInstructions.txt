How to compile MrBayes from source
==================================

Pre-requirements:

You will need the following software to build MrBayes:
* gcc (or other C++ compiler)
* autotools (autoconf, automake, etc)
* Optional: MPI compiler and library
* Optional: Beagle library

Compilation: 
To compile MrBayes in UNIX like environment, first navigate to the folder
containing the source code. Then execute the following commands in your terminal:

> autoconf
> ./configure 
> make

The compilation will produce an executable in the source directory with the name
"mb". To start the program, simply type

> ./mb

For more convenient access to the program, you may want to install it in your
path, in which case you can invoke the program from any directory on your
computer by simply typing

> mb

If you wish to make the program available to all users in this way, you can use

> sudo make install

after having compiled the program.


Configuration options
=====================

1) BEAGLE

MrBayes 3.2 uses the BEAGLE library by default. You should either install the
BEAGLE library from http://code.google.com/p/beagle-lib/ or disable use of the
library by invoking the configure script with option "--with-beagle=no". i.e. 

> ./configure --with-beagle=no

Note: without beagle library MrBayes may run slower.


2) SSE code

All main-stream modern processors have support for SSE instructions 
which are utilized by default by MrBayes 3.2 in order to substantially speed up
execution. If you experience problems with the SSE code, you can disable the use of
SSE code by invoking the configure script with the option "–-enable-sse=no", i.e.


> ./configure --enable-sse=no

If you use SSE code, you may encounter problems with older compilers. Specifically,
if you are getting errors about undefined reference to "posix_memalign", you should
update your compiler. You should have libc library of at least version 2.1.91 for
the SSE code to compile.


3) MPI version

To make use of MPI code to parallelize MrBayes computations across several processors
or CPU cores, you should invoke the configure script with the option
"--enable-mpi=yes". The MPI code can be used both together with the Beagle library
and the SSE code. Your computer also needs to have an MPI implementation installed,
for instance OpenMPI or MPICH, and the environment needs to be set up to run MPI
programs. To install an MPI version of MrBayes using BEAGLE and SSE, use:

> autoconf
> ./configure --enable-mpi=yes
> make

The resulting program will be called mb. A typical run might be started with a
command like:

> mpirun -np 8 mb data.nex > output.txt &

This will run MrBayes on eight processors or cores (-np 8), using the data file
"data.nex" as input. The output will not be printed to screen but to the file
"output.txt" (> output.txt). The ampersand (&) causes the control to return
immediately to the console, while the job will continue running in the background.

To examine the most recent output from the run, you might e.g. use the tail command
of UNIX like this:

> tail -f output.txt

This will print the lines onto the screen as they get added to the file "output.txt".
To stop the output, simply press ctrl-C (this will stop the output from the tail
command, it will not stop the MrBayes run).


Trouble shooting compilation problems
=====================================

Problem: The compilation process hangs on model.c when using compiler that comes with
developer kit on MacOSX 10.7.X Lion.

Solution: Install another compiler. For example you can use MacPorts (macports.org) 
to install gcc, openmpi and other open source tools.

To install openmpi using MacPorts type in terminal:

>sudo port install openmpi

Installing openmpi will give you a compiler which is newer than the one bundled
with Apple's Developer Tools. It will not hang while compiling mrbayes.
Openmpi installed by the command above will be installed into /opt/local.
Unfortunately, it will NOT install the required "mpicc", but "openmpicc" instead.
That means that configuring MrBayes won't work.

Fix this after the installation by creating a symbolic link to openmpicc:

>cd /opt/local/bin
>sudo ln -s openmpicc mpicc
