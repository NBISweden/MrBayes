    <h2>Manual and Other Resources</h2>


    <h3>Manual</h3>


    <p>A good resource for new users is the MrBayes 3.2 manual, which
    contains instructions for downloading and installing the program,
    two tutorials including a qick-start version, discussions of all
    the models implemented in the program, answers to some frequently
    asked questions, a list of the differences between versions 2 and 3
    of the program, instructions for compiling and running the parallel
    version of the program, and tips for users who want to tweak the
    source code or contribute bug fixes or new functionality. In an
    appendix, there is a diagrammatic summary of all the models
    implemented in the program and most of the proposal mechanisms. You
    can download the manual (pdf) <a href=
    "./assets/mb3.2_manual.pdf">here</a>.</p>


    <h3>Online Help</h3>


    <p>MrBayes 3 provides extensive online help through the 'help'
    command. Simply type 'help' at the command prompt to get a list of
    the available commands. Type 'help &lt;command&gt;' to get help
    information for a specific command. For instance, 'help lset' will
    give you the help information for the 'lset' command, including a
    discussion of all the available parameters and options. The help
    information for a command typically also includes a summary table
    of the options and current settings.</p>


    <h3>Command Reference</h3>


    <p>You can produce a text file containing all the help information
    for the current version of the program by using the 'manual'
    command in MrBayes. If you produce this file immediately after
    starting the program, the text file will contain all the default
    settings and can be used as a command reference. If you prefer not
    to produce this file yourself, you can download a pdf copy <a href=
    "./assets/commref_mb3.2.pdf">here</a>.</p>


    <h3>E-mail List</h3>


    <p>Finally, a good resource for resolving problems with MrBayes is
    the MrBayes <a href=
    "https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mrbayes-users">mailing
    list</a>. You can ask a question about MrBayes by simply posting a
    message to this list. Before you can send a message to the list,
    however, you need to subscribe to it as explained on the home page
    of the mailing list (see the link above). The <a href=
    "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/mailman/mrbayes-users/">archive</a>
    is accessible to everyone.</p>


    <h3>General Advice</h3>


    <p>Remember that MrBayes is free software and that it currently has
    thousands of users around the world. Therefore, there is no
    possibility for the authors to provide extensive user help. Please
    first read the manual and the command reference carefully to make
    sure the problem you are having is not addressed there. If this
    does not help, try using the MrBayes email list to pose your
    question. If the problem you are having seems to be a bug in the
    program, report it using the bug reporting tool provided on
    SourceForge, as described <a href="issues.html">here</a>. If you
    have general questions about the MrBayes project, the models and
    MCMC sampling algorithms implemented in the program, or the future
    development of the project, you are welcome to email the <a href=
    "authors.html">authors</a> directly.</p>
