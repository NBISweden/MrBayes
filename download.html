    <h2>Download MrBayes</h2>


    <p>Mrbayes may be downloaded as a pre-compiled executable or in
    source form.</p>


    <h3>Current release</h3>


    <p>The current version of MrBayes is <a href=
    "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/tree/v3.2.6">3.2.6</a>,
    released November 25, 2015. Pre-compiled executables, as well as
    the release source may be found on GitHub. You can download
    executable versions for <a href=
    "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/blob/v3.2.6/MrBayes-3.2.6_WIN32_x64.zip">
    Windows (32-bit and 64-bit)</a>, and <a href=
    "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/blob/v3.2.6/MrBayes-3.2.6_MACx64.zip">
    Macintosh (64bit)</a> computers, as well as the <a href=
    "https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes/blob/v3.2.6/mrbayes-3.2.6.tar.gz">
    source code</a> for compilation on Unix machines. The Mac installer
    includes both the serial and parallel (MPI) version of the program,
    while the Windows installer only includes the serial version; both
    include the BEAGLE library (v2.1). The serial version works well
    for smaller analyses but if you plan to run large analyses using
    many parallel chains, you should use the MPI version instead. Refer
    to the <a href="manual.html">User Manual</a> for help with
    installation of the program.</p>


    <h3>Older releases</h3>


    <p>You can get access to older releases from release 3.2.0 onwards:

    <h3>Mailing List</h3>


    <p>A great aid for resolving problems with MrBayes is the MrBayes
    <a href=
    "https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mrbayes-users">mailing
    list</a>. If you have a question about MrBayes you can ask it by
    posting the question to the mailing list. To post on this list you
    have to be subscribed to it. However, the <a href=
    "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/mailman/mrbayes-users/">list
    archive</a> is accessible to everyone.</p>


    <p>The list will also be used by the MrBayes authors for
    announcements of new versions or bugfixes. We, therefore, recommend
    that you subscribe to the list if you are a regular MrBayes
    user.</p>
