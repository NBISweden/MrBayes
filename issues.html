    <h2>Reporting a Bug</h2>


    <p><em>NOTE:</em> Bug reporting is being moved over from
    SourceForge to GitHub. This move is on ongoing project. This means
    that the info on this page regarding the SourceForge bug tracker is
    out of date. It will be updated when the old bug tickets have been
    migrated to GitHub issues</p>


    <p>The best way to report a bug is with the <a href=
    "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/bugs/">bug report tool</a> on
    the MrBayes Sourceforge project page. With this tool one can look
    at previously reported bugs. Here you can chose different filters
    to select only those bug reports that satisfy you search criteria.
    If the problem you have encountered is not listed here, you can
    submit a new bugreport by clicking the <a href=
    "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/bugs/new/">Create Ticket</a>
    link.</p>


    <h3>Submit a new bug</h3>


    <p>On the bug report page there are a few optional choices:</p>


    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><em>Category</em>: Where did the bug appear, e.g. in the MPI
        part.</p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Group</em>: In which version of MrBayes did the bug
        appear, e.g. version 3.2 or earliar. Note however that we
        discontinue fixing bugs for versions earlier than 3.2 (3.1 or
        earlier). The bug report about version before 3.2 is only
        useful as information to other users outlining the bug. If you
        have problems with version before 3.2, please try MrBayes 3.2
        and if the problem persist, report it as a bug of version
        3.2.</p>
      </li>


      <li>
        <p><em>Private</em>: is a visibility flag. When it marked your
        post will be visible only to administrators (developers of
        Mrbayes) and not to the general public.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>


    <p>In the mandatory fields <em>Summary</em> and
    <em>Description</em> you can describe the bug. Keep in mind that
    the <b>only</b> way for us to solve the bug is if <b>we can repeat
    it</b>. See for example, the article <a href=
    "http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to
    Report Bugs Effectively</a>.</p>


    <p>The bug tool allows you to attach files to your bug report. You
    can find this upload option at the end of the report page.</p>


    <p>We would very much appreciate if you can send us nexus file
    which on its execution courses the problem that you describe in
    your bug report. Nexus file much like a picture may worth thousands
    of words. Please specify after how many generation you encountered
    the problem if it is applicable. It would be even more kind of you
    if you could provide a log file containing the whole output of the
    run. If resulting log file is too big you can cat out routine
    printout of likelihood, leaving the beginning of the run where
    analyze is set up and the final (crash) messages. If you have
    multiple files to send you should pack them first into one by tar,
    zip or any other commonly used compression program.</p>


    <p>If instead of using release version of MrBayes you are using
    development version from the trunk, then please specify which
    release you are using. The release number is printed after latter
    'r' on the first line printed by MrBayes when it started. The first
    line may look like this 'MrBayes v3.2-svn(r456)', which means that
    you have release number 456. Also if you compiled MrBayes with
    non-default options then please let us know what they were.</p>


    <p>Later versions (&gt;3.2.6 only) of MrBayes have an extended
    "Version" command that displays not only the version of the
    software, but also what features it was compiled with, what type of
    host the software was compiled for, as well as the vendor and
    version of the compiler that was used. This information would be
    useful in any bug report.</p>


    <p>When you are satisfied with your report, you can submit it by
    pressing the <em>Save</em> button. Although Sourceforge asks you to
    login, you don't have to. The bug report will then be filled
    anonymously, but you might want to add your e-mail address in the
    report, so we can contact you if further details are needed.</p>


    <h2>Mailing list</h2>


    <p>A great aid for resolving problems with MrBayes is the MrBayes
    <a href=
    "https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mrbayes-users">mailing
    list</a>. If you have a general question about MrBayes you can ask
    it by posting the question to the mailing list. To post on this
    list you have to be subscribed to it. The <a href=
    "https://sourceforge.net/p/mrbayes/mailman/mrbayes-users/">list
    archive</a> is accessible for everyone.</p>
