MrBayes 3.2.7-dev (development not-yet-3.2.7 version)
========================================================================

Make a shallow clone of the repository:

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/NBISweden/MrBayes.git

(a shallow clone requires less than 30 Mb of disk space, a full clone
requires about 205 Mb)


Building MrBayes using the supplied "configure" script:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code in the MrBayes Git repository comes with a standard GNU
"configure" script.  On any Unix system, these are the steps required to
compile and optionally install MrBayes:

* Run "configure" in the top-level directory to create "Makefile" (see
  "./configure --help" for info about enabling and disabling features of
  MrBayes, or how to install in non-standard locations etc., and also
  read further down in this document):

        $ ./configure

* Make (i.e. compile) the project:

        $ make

  Note that if "pdflatex" or "bibtex" could not be found by the
  "configure" script, the PDF documentation in doc/manual and
  doc/tutorial will not be rebuilt, even if the PDF documents are
  outdated or missing.

* Install it on the system (optional).  This will install
  the executable "mb" in /usr/local/bin, the documentation
  in /usr/local/share/doc/mrbayes, and the example files in
  /usr/local/share/examples/mrbayes unless the default installation
  prefix ("/usr/local") is changed with the "--prefix" option when
  running "configure".

        $ make install

To build a statically linked version of MrBayes, set the environment
variable LDFLAGS to "-static" when configuring:

    $ env LDFLAGS=-static ./configure


Building MrBayes using the GNU autotools (Autoconf and Automake):
------------------------------------------------------------------------

MrBayes uses the GNU autotools, i.e. Automake and Autoconf, for its
configuration and build system.  To tinker with "configure.ac" and
"Makefile.am" and then to regenerate the "configure" script and
associated files, there are some prerequisites that need to be in place:

* Make sure Automake 1.16 (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
  is installed.

* Make sure Autoconf 2.69 (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
  is installed.

The "configure.ac" script here uses the "pkg-config" tool for detection
of external libraries (Beagle) and also uses m4 macros from the
autoconf-archive collection for detection of MPI, Readline, and some
architecture-dependent compiler flags.  Therefore,

* Make sure pkg-config (https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)
  is installed.

* Make sure autoconf-archive 2016.03.20 (or later)
  (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/) is installed.

* On some systems that uses metaauto for wrapping multiple versions of
  the GNU autotools (OpenBSD for example):

        $ export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.69
        $ export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.16

* On Ubuntu Linux, installing the following packages installs all of the
  above prerequisites:

    1. automake
    2. autoconf
    3. pkg-config
    4. autoconf-archive

  These may be installed through

    sudo apt-get install automake autoconf pkg-config autoconf-archive

When all the prerequisites are in place:

* Run "autoreconf" to generate the "configure" script:

        $ autoreconf -i

* Then continue as outlined earlier in this document.


Disabling the SSE, AVX and FMA code paths
------------------------------------------------------------------------

MrBayes will use SSE, AVX and FMA instructions to speed up computations
on CPUs that support these instruction sets, if the compiler supports
it.  These code paths are however optional, and if you suspect a bug in
part of this code, you may use "--disable-sse", "--disable-avx" and/or
"--disable-fma" to disable it when running the "configure" script.

Note however, that disabling SSE will also disable AVX and FMA, and
disabling AVX will also disable FMA.

Note also that disabling these accelerated code paths will not remove
the "-msse" (etc.) compiler flags.  These compiler flags affects what
instructions the compiler is allowed to generate, not what code path is
choosen for compilation.


Picking up the Beagle library:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming Beagle (https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib) was compiled
and installed in a standard location, it will be picked up by the
"configure" script automatically.  If it isn't found, or the "configure"
script is run with "--without-beagle", Beagle will not be used.

If Beagle is installed in a non-default location, there are three ways
of telling the "configure" script how to find it:

1.  Use the flag "--with-beagle=PATH" where "PATH" is the prefix path
    where the Beagle headers and libraries may be found.  For example
    "$HOME/local", "/opt" etc.  The paths "/usr/local" and "/usr" are
    tested if no path is specified.

2.  Point the "PKG_CONFIG_PATH" environment variable to the "pkgconfig"
    directory that Beagle installed its "hmsbeagle-1.pc" file into.
    This file is installed if Beagle was compiled from sources, and
    may be found in the installation's "lib" directory.  The detection
    of Beagle will fall back on using "pkg-config" which picks up this
    file.

3.  As a last resort, it's also possible to set the "BEAGLE_CFLAGS" and
    "BEAGLE_LIBS" environment variables prior to running "configure":

    $ env BEAGLE_CFLAGS="-I$HOME/local/include/hmsbeagle-1" \
          BEAGLE_LIBS="-L$HOME/local/lib -lhmsbeagle" \
          ./configure


Picking up and using MPI:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "configure" script will find any available MPI C compiler or
compiler wrapper and use it (for example the one provided by OpenMPI
(https://www.open-mpi.org/) or MPICH (https://www.mpich.org/)) if
the "--with-mpi" flag is used.  If this flag is not used, or if
"--without-mpi" is used, MrBayes will be compiled without support for
MPI parallelization.

You may set the "MPICC" environment variable to the name or path of a
specific MPI C compiler, if you have many to choose from:

    $ env MPICC="/usr/local/bin/mpicc" ./configure --with-mpi


About support for the GNU Readline library:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

MrBayes will be compiled with support for the GNU Readline Library
(https://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) (which
allows for command line history within an interactive session, and
command completion through pressing the "tab" key) if the Readline
library and its associated header files are available.  However, it
seems as if the Readline library doesn't work well together with common
MPI implementations (OpenMPI (https://www.open-mpi.org/) and MPICH
(https://www.mpich.org/)), so if MrBayes is configured with support for
MPI parallelization, Readline support will be automatically disabled.

A possible workaround is to use a "Readline wrapper", such as "rlwrap"
(https://github.com/hanslub42/rlwrap), which gives you persistent
command line history between sessions, but no command tab-completion.
To use rlwrap with an MPI-enabled MrBayes, simply start MrBayes like
this:

    $ rlwrap mb


# vim: filetype=text
